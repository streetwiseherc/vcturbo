            <P><B>Overview of VC Turbo</B><BR>VC Turbo is a new version of the 
            Volcano Coffee sample site that shipped with Site Server, Commerce 
            Edition 3.0. It has been modified to show how to improve performance 
            and capacity for a Commerce Server site. VC Turbo forgoes certain 
            features to achieve these improvements. Please see The Microsoft 
            Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition Performance Kit for the detailed 
            documentation on these changes. 
            (http://www.microsoft.com/siteserver/commerce/.) Volcano Coffee is 
            documented in the Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition documentation. 
            <P>VC Turbo is a new addition to the set of Commerce Server 3.0 
            sample sites (the Clocktower, Volcano Coffee, Microsoft Press, 
            Microsoft Market, and Trey Research sample sites were shipped with 
            Site Server 3.0, Commerce Edition, and all except Trey Research are 
            included in the Typical installation). It may be useful to compare 
            the VC Turbo site to other sample sites to learn about differences 
            and similarities. 
            <P>The VC Turbo site can be copied using the Commerce Site Builder 
            Wizard. For information, see Site Creation, Operation, and 
            Administration in the Commerce Server 3.0 documentation. 
            <P><I>Note:</I> VC Turbo, like other Commerce Server 3.0 sample
            sites, is intended to demonstrate features of Commerce Server 3.0.
            It can be used as the basis for creating a live production site. <A

            <P><B>Known issues</B> 
            <P><I>Incompatibility between Microsoft FrontPage and Commerce 
            pages</I><BR>Microsoft FrontPage98 is not recommended for editing 
            ASP files unless the files were originally created in FrontPage. 
            Since the Commerce Server sample sites were not generated by 
            FrontPage, editing them in FrontPage can result in loss of data and 
            site functionality. For more information, see <A 
            href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/">http://www.microsoft.com/support/</A> 
            You can, however, use Microsoft Visual InterDev 1.0 (a component of 
            Microsoft Visual Studio 97). Visual InterDev 1.0 was used to develop 
            the VC Turbo site. For information about editing a Commerce Server 
            site in Visual InterDev, see How Do I... in the Commerce 
            documentation. 
            <P><I>Unable to delete a site's directory</I><BR>Occasionally, when 
            removing VC Turbo using WebAdmin or the Commerce Host Administration 
            snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), an error message 
            is displayed indicating that &quot;Deleting files partially or 
            completely failed.&quot; Clicking the Details button displays a 
            message indicating that the directory is not empty. This error 
            occurs when the snap-in fails to remove the VCTurbo directory and/or 
            its content. 
            <P>If this occurs, you should manually delete the VCTurbo directory. 
            If you receive an &quot;Error Deleting File&quot; message when 
            attempting to remove the VCTurbo directory, reboot your computer and 
            then delete the directory. 
            <P><I>SSL Security</I> To use SSL, the computer must have a server
            certificate obtained from a valid Certificate Authority (CA). By
            default, Secure HTTP is not enabled in the site so that you can use
            the site even if the computer does not have a certificate. To enable
            Secure HTTP, start the Commerce Host Administration snap-in for the
            Microsoft Management Console (MMC). In the scope pane, right-click
            the name of the site, and then click Properties on the shortcut
            menu. Click the Security tab, and then select the Enable HTTPS check
            box. For Secure host name, type the name of the server that you want
            to use for processing secure HTTP posts. <A name=setup></A>

            <P><I>Requirements</I> 
            <UL>
              <LI>To use the VC Turbo site, you must have already installed Site 
              Server 3.0, Commerce Edition. 
              <LI>The site is designed for use only with Microsoft® Internet 
              Explorer 4.01 and Microsoft® SQL Server 6.5. </LI></UL><A 
            name=installing></A>
            <P><I>Installing the VC Turbo site</I><BR>The VC Turbo site is 
            packaged as a self-extracting executable file. To install the site, 
            double-click the VCTurbo.exe file to launch Setup, which installs 
            the site into the appropriate directories. VC Turbo is installed in 
            \inetpub\wwwroot\ or whatever directory you specified as the Web 
            root during the installation of Microsoft Internet Information 
            Server (IIS). 
            <P>You must have already created a database for the sample site's
            files. During setup, you must select the name of the DSN to use for
            connecting to the database, and you must supply the database login
            name and password. It is recommended that you install VC Turbo in
            the same database as the one used for the rest of the sample sites
            during the Commerce Server 3.0 installation. <A name=removing></A>
            <P><I>Removing (uninstalling) the VC Turbo site</I><BR>Use the
            Commerce Server administration tools (MMC, WebAdmin, or
            command-line) to remove the VC Turbo site. On the Start menu, point
            to Programs, point to Microsoft Site Server, point to
            Administration, and then click Site Server Service Admin (MMC).
            Expand Commerce Host Administration, select the host (server) on
            which the site is installed, and then click OK. In the scope (left)
            pane, right-click the VCTurbo folder, and then click Delete on the
            shortcut menu. <A name=explore></A>
            <P><B>Explore the site</B><BR>Like the other Commerce Server sample 
            sites, VC Turbo has both a catalog (shopping) site and Manager 
            pages. 
            <P>Shopping site: http://localhost/VCTurbo/ 
            <P>Manager pages: http://localhost/VCTurbo/manager/ 
            <P>When testing VC Turbo, you can use the following test credit-card
